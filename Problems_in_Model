Problems: -
The random forest model appears to have an overfitting problem. For the training set, the model had 100% accuracy, precision, and F1-score, however on the testing set, it only had an F1-score of 0.07. This shows that the model is having problems successfully generalizing to fresh data, a typical issue in machine learning. To address this issue, one possible solution is to reduce the complexity of the model. This can be achieved by decreasing the max_depth parameter of the random forest or by increasing the min_samples_split parameter. These changes will reduce the complexity of the decision tree models used in the random forest and may result in better generalization performance.
Another solution is to use regularization techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, or dropout. These methods can help prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models or by stopping the training process early before the model starts to memorize the training data.
It may also be helpful to explore other models or to perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model. For example, we could experiment with logistic regression or support vector machines, or we could create new features that capture important patterns in the data.
